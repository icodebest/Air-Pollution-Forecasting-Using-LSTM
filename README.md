# Air Pollution Forecasting Using LSTM

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of air pollution forecasting using machine learning. The goal is to predict the air quality based on several input features and visualize the predicted results. The following steps are covered in this notebook:

## Project Overview

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - The notebook begins with loading and cleaning the dataset to ensure that it is ready for model training. 
   - Features are processed and transformed to be used as inputs for the model.

### 2. **Model Building**
   - A machine learning model (e.g., neural network, regression model, etc.) is defined and trained using the preprocessed data.
   - The model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to check its performance.

### 3. **Prediction**
   - The trained model is then used to make predictions based on user input or additional test data.

### 4. **Visualization**
   - After predictions, visualizations (e.g., graphs, plots) are generated to show the relationship between the input features and the predicted air quality.
   - Visualizations also help demonstrate how well the model is performing and provide insights into the data.

### 5. **Conclusion**
   - The final section of the notebook summarizes the findings, discusses the model performance, and suggests next steps or improvements.
